 * @file shop_cart.h
 * @author Tuva Bj√∂rnberg & Marcus Ray Sandersson
 * @date 2/10-2023
 * @brief  A simple implementation of a shopping cart system. 
 * 
 * The code supports creating and managing shopping carts, adding and removing items,
 * calculating the total cost of items in a cart, and checking out a cart.
 * 
 * The main structure is the ioopm_carts_t type, which includes a hash table where cart IDs
 * map to the items in the cart. Each cart is represented by a hash table where merch
 * names map to the quantity of each item.
 * 
 * The hash table assumes a suitable hash_function (hash_fun) and equality function 
 * to fit the ioopm_eq_function in common.h.
 * 
 * Error handling, such as invalid inputs (NULL etc.), is mostly done in the frontend (ui.c). 
 * Since this is a coherent project across several modules, the functions in this module wont 
 * handle most edge cases and invalid inputs. All functions expect valid and existing inputs
 * following the relevant structs.
 * 
 * It is assumed that the user ensures proper memory management after creating and 
 * manipulating shopping carts, as these structures involve dynamic memory allocation.
