 * @date 
 * @brief Utils for printing questions and reading answers from command line or file. 
 * 
 * If an invalid answer is input into the command line or from file the user will
 * have to retry until a valid answer can be returned. For example if answering with
 * a letter to ask_question_int will not return until an int is input. 
 * 
 * It is assumed that the user ensures proper memory management when using the ask_questions functions,
 * since the functiosn returning char * types heap allocates memory.
